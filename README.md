# vertigo-bot-factory

A "digital platform adoption" application, to help application owners guiding their users into using efficently their applications.
For your users, this platform gives them an easy access to meaningful information, pointers, documents..., relevant to their context (profiles, pages/files opened...).
For your team, this plateform allows to quickly help in the adoption of new applications, new functionalities; follow their usage and pain points and react with improvments to the information provided to them.

It allows an immediate activation of multiple functionalities in order to:
- Show users useful links and documents to navigate through the application, adapted to the user's context.
- Show an easily manageable list of frequently asked questions and their answers, adapted to the same context.
- Creating chatbot to help users with a self-care solution and mitigate calls/messages to the support team.
- Provide "guided tours" of an application and its screens, with only the tours adapted to the users context.
- Integrating with other applications, such as Confluence spaces and JIRA projects, to provide better help with existing resources.
